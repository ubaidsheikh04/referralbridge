I will create another API route, likely at src/pages/api/razorpay/verify-payment.ts.
The frontend handler function (from step 3) will call this endpoint after a successful payment attempt, sending the razorpay_payment_id, razorpay_order_id, and razorpay_signature.
This backend endpoint will use the Razorpay SDK and your key_secret to verify the payment signature. This ensures the payment information hasn't been tampered with.
